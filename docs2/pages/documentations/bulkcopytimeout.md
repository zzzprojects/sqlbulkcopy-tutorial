    // SET BulkCopyTimeout value.

## Recommendation
- Higher is better!

### Higher is better!
 - Recommended BulkCopyTimeout Value: **300**
 
Ensure to set the BulkCopyTimeout to at least 3x of the time the SqlBulkCopy need to complete the transaction.

If the operation may take up to 20s, specify a value of at least of 60s.

You don't know in one year what could happen! A file importation that started small may have grown to millions of rows. There is nothing worse than an application crashing in production because of a Timeout exception occurred!
